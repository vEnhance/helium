\begin{abstract}
	Helium is a grading system for math contests.
	It was developed for HMMT in October of 2016 following inspiration
	from the Stanford Math Tournament's new Atomic Grader.

	Helium is built using Django to be compatible with
	HMMT's then-existing structure.
	It features scan-based grading, a rapid-fire score input system,
	as well as support for direct score entry.
	Conflict resolution is handled automatically,
	as well as generating of results according to the
	HMMT scoring algorithm.
	The Django admin interface is built in.

	This documentation is split into several parts.
	Chapters are dedicated to graders (day-of volunteers),
	officers (trusted staff members with extra responsibilities),
	system administrators (who need to set up the system before the tournament),
	and finally other developers (who wish to play with code),
	with each section more technical and detailed than the last.

	The appendix consists of a list of terminology which
	will be used throughout the manual.
