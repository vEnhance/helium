\chapter{Instructions for Helium administrator}
Here are some tasks you need to do to set up Helium
to work before the tournament.

\section{Create the exams}
You need to produce the exams.
Remember to input colors corresponding to how the answer sheets will be tinted.

Right now the only way to do this is in the Django admin by hand,
but eventually we will support importing these from HMMT Problems database.
Sorry, this is a pain, I know.

\section{Import entities from registration}
In Babbage a command called ``import entities from reg'' will do this for you.
It is careful, and will never import the same entity twice.

\section{Printing and checking scans}
You should make sure that a large number of answer sheets are printed,
and in different colors between tests to avoid errors.

Unfortunately, right now the scan regions (i.e.\ the cut-outs)
are hard-coded into \verb+scanimage.py+.
So before the tournament you should check the scanners being used
and verify that the cut-out regions are compatible with the scanner.

The file \verb+scanimage.py+ has a facility to make this easier.
If you run
\begin{center}
\verb+python /path/to/scanimage.py FILENAME.pdf+
\end{center}
then it will generate (in the current directory)
the images corresponding to the cut-outs.
Thus you can test this locally and make adjustments to the regions if needed.

\section{Test data}
\subsection{Location}
Some test data has been provided for you.
You can look for it in the following places:
\begin{itemize}
	\ii \verb+:/helium/static/batchX-samplescans.pdf+
	\ii \verb+:/helium/static/batchY-samplescans.pdf+
	\ii \verb+:/helium/fixtures/*+
\end{itemize}
The easiest thing to do is to load the two fixtures in the ``setup'' directory,
which will populate the exams and entities tables.
The sample scans correspond exactly to the entities in these fixtures.

You can also load fixtures in the \verb+:/helium/fixtures/scenarios+ directly
which are snapshots of the entire database at various points in time
in the test run
(after matching exams, after grading, after algorithmic scoring, etc.).
But note that the \verb+/media/+ folder is NOT included.

\emph{Warning}: the scenarios folder contains a superuser
with name and password ``evan''
as well as a staff user with name and password ``staff1''.
Consequently, be careful to NOT run these on production,
as we will then have some very insecure user accounts!

\subsection{Synopsis of test data}
Synopsis of test data:

\begin{itemize}
\ii There is a single scan-based exam, called ``GEO!'',
and there is a single non-scanned exam, called ``Mock IMO''.
The former is $10$ problems scored algorithmically.
The latter is $3$ problems worth $7$ points each.

\ii There are $16$ mathletes split into three teams of five,
corresponding to characters from \emph{L\'es Miserables},
\emph{Wicked}, and the \emph{Phantom of the Opera},
plus one unaffiliated individual named ``Evan Chen''.

\ii The two sample batches contain all their ``GEO!'' exams.
The answers to that exam corresponding exactly to the real answers
to the HMMT February 2016 Geometry test.
\end{itemize}
